## Getting Started
* **Change the ComputerName etc.** in ./configure.sh before proceeding

## Software to Install Manually
* [Adobe Photoshop Elements 10](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop-elements/kb/download-earlier-version-photoshop-elements.html), you might have to run the installer as with sudo to succeed, else it might keep giving weird error.
* Popcorn Time

## IMPORTANT
* Accessibility access cannot be enabled automatically on this version of macOS which is needed for Spectacle. You will have to do it on first launch.
* App Store login may not work the first time with `mas`. Open App Store once before running the `X-app-store.sh`.

## Interesting Strategies
* Look at the [macOS menu related stuff](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/commit/398496c2372d65c0e6770d02b0c5b49c0d636f31#diff-db672f7be337a783b0a45f6fb67ac7f0)
